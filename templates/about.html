<h3 id="monthly">Paid monthly newsletter</h3>

<p>I write a <em>lot</em> of stuff. If you like you can <strong>pay me to send you less</strong>. At the end of every month I send out a much shorter newsletter to anyone who <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/simonw">sponsors me for $10 or more on GitHub</a>. It's intended to be a ten minute read that catches you up on the most important developments from the past month in LLMs and my other projects and research.</p>

<h3 id="disclosures">Disclosures</h3>

{% filter markdownify %}
I do not receive any compensation for writing about specific topics on this blog - no sponsored content! I plan to continue this policy. If I ever change this I will disclose that both here and in the post itself.

Part of work on [Datasette Cloud](https://www.datasette.cloud/) is sponsored by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). I have a generous set of [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/simonw) who support my work on Datasette and other open source projects.

I am currently a member of the board of directors [for the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/board/).

I am a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/simonw/) (an unpaid position). GitHub paid me as a participant of their [GitHub Accelerator](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-accelerator-our-first-cohort-and-whats-next/) program in 2023.

Mozilla supported my work as part of [their MIECO program](https://web.archive.org/web/20240917063820/https://future.mozilla.org/mieco2023/) (Internet Ecosystem program) in 2023-2024.

I have not accepted payments from LLM vendors, but I am frequently invited to preview new LLM products and features from organizations that include OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and Mistral, often under NDA or subject to an embargo. This often also includes free API credits and invitations to events.

*One exception: OpenAI paid my for my time when I attended a GPT-5 preview at their office which was [used in a video](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/7/previewing-gpt-5/). They did not ask for any editorial insight or control over what I wrote after that event, aside from keeping to their embargo.*

I run ads on my blog using [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/). I also earn money from Twitter's [Creator Revenue Sharing](https://help.x.com/en/using-x/creator-revenue-sharing) program, and try not to let that incentivize me to post engagement bait!

I provide ad-hoc consulting and training services to a number of different companies and organizations. If any of those represent a conflict of interest with my writing here I will disclose that in the relevant post.
